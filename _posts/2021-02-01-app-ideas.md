## Urine Analysis Tools
* We know urine analysis is possible > smart toilets exist that do that (see articles)
* What can be measured: 
    * pH value – can determine urinary tract infections and risk for urinary stones
    * Substances not typically found in urine, protein, sugar, nitrite, ketone, bilirubin, urobilnogen, red blood cells, white blood cells (diabetes detections, kidney infection)
    * STDs
    * Drug tests 
    * Hydration

## App Features
* Test Results
* Alerts when clogged
* Control over self-cleaning
* Usage counter/Flush counter/Clean counter
* Individual mode and manager mode
* Recognition: Credit card/Apple pay, or facial recognition, QR Code scanner
* Product Recommendations– e.g. Gatorade if dehydrated 
* Map of Smart-Wizes similar to Tesla’s supercharger map (can be turned off by store owner), so people know where a toilet is nearby – perhaps even an indication if purchase is required
