Lead resists pinhole leaks

Lead > 15 ppb or copper > 1.3 ppm, the system must be fixed

1.6 gpf > maximum allowed by law in the US > Watersense is if the average used is 20% less than maximum

High Efficiency Urinal > uses half gallon or less of water

Soybean paste > MaP testing

Ultra-low-flow  = high effiency 

Low flow = low consumption

Conference for PMI typically in October

Average American uses 88 gallons of water per day at home – 50% in bathrooms

**Urinals in public places get flushed 18 times a day on average**

Watersense HE -> 1.28 GPF or less

Sinks -> 1.5 GPM

Showers -> 2.0 GPM

Urinals -> 0.5 GPF – 2010 first watersense

Flusometer Valve -> 1.28 GPF, minimum 1 GPF

75% of toilets are water-sense certified

Prior to 1992 – 3.5 GPF

High Efficient Toilets required – Texas, Oregon, Georgia, Colorado, California, Miami

216 million are 1.6 GPF, 1.28GPF or less – 56 million, 3.5 GPF is 52 million, 5.0 is 9.3 million

16.8% market penetration for watersense in the US

Average toilets per bathroom – 1, sinks – 1.46, showerheads – 0.93

### Surfaces
* Ceramic glaze
* Hydrophilc – water hits, spreads and makes a thin film – more popular
* Hydrophobic – water hits, and will typically repel
* Photocatalytic – break down organic matter when exposed to UV light
* Nanoseptic surfaces – nano-crystals bonded to paper-like material and powered by lighting – similar to * Photocatalytic
* Anitmicrobial/Antibaetrial additives – silver based
* Ceramic surface coatings for metal

Urinals listed on Kohler’s site are 25% marked down on Home Depot. Likely sold at 50% price to home depot, who then marks it up 25%. Its always 25% lower on Amazon, Home Depot than Kohler etc. Some analysis her would be good. Higher markdown for more expensive items (44%). A scraper here would be good.
